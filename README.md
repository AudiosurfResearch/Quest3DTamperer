# Quest3DTamperer
**PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS STILL BEING WORKED ON!**

This is a tool to mess with Quest3D games (mainly Audiosurf)

# Features
- Show information about channel groups (Name, protection and read-only status, file path)
- Remove protection and read-only status from channel groups and save them, allowing them to be opened by the Quest3D editor for inspection or editing.
- Load .cgr files into the game (**NOTE:** For some reason, my own files didn't load correctly when testing, but ones included in the game work)

More to come soon-ish.
