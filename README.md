# Quest3DTamperer
**PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS STILL IN VERY EARLY DEVELOPMENT!**

This is a tool made for messing with Quest3D games (mainly Audiosurf) to inspect and hopefully learn about their inner workings.

# DISCLAIMER
This tool is not supposed to:
- Enable piracy (There's way better ways for that than using this tool anyway)
- Enable cheating online (The tool can't even do this in its current state)
- Cause thermonuclear war

# Features
- Show information about channel groups (Name, protection and read-only status, file path)
- Remove protection and read-only status from channel groups and save them, allowing them to be opened by the Quest3D editor for inspection or editing.
- Load .cgr files into the game (**NOTE:** Not tested properly, don't count on it working)
- Read strings from some channels (Support added for the most common ones)
- Read script source code of Lua script channels

More to come soon-ish.
